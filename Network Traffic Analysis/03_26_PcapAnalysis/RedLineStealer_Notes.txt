System was infected. It began communication with 194.26.135.119
Began running commands on the infected system, providing any info it could on crypto wallets on the system

Total packets in conversation with infected system and malsite = 787

Looks like in the conversation it took all the info and put into a word docx file called Top_secret_ducment.docx, placed in the user's Documents directory

Checked who else 10.7.10.47 had conversations with.
Bunch of packets to 10.7.10.9 -- Possible DC server
-- Name as seen on network is WIN-S3WT6LGQFVX


First packet to 194.26.135.119 was at 22:39:50.151051 (UTC)
Last packet to 194.26.135.119 was at 22:39:58.364177 (UTC)

Total packet capture from
22:39:22.849048 to 22:39:58.364177

Need to understand what are NBNS, CLDAP, KRB5 packets

Second malicious IP 204.79.197.200 - Appears to be a MS Azure Cloud account takeover - Possibly used by the attacker to send the docx file over. Can't tell since many packets are encrypted (TLS 1.2), don't have the keys to decrypt it.
Conversation started by infected system at 22:39:34.644850 to 22:39:43.986040

notable packets
215 - 22:39:23.594750 (UTC) SMB call to the server IPC$

-- Getting info from server. Is this normal or is it the malware trying to find a domain controller or file server?
