bat file contains the good old @echo off (not print lines on what it is doing)

See Powershell call and an xcopy command

Grabbed base64 output and decoded. Output is a gzip file:
decoded.output: gzip compressed data, max speed, from FAT filesystem (MS-DOS, OS/2, NT), original size modulo 2^32 800256

Unzip the file and it appears to be just data.
Ran strings and at the bottom I see "This program cannot be run in DOS Mode" at the bottom line and mirrored."

This is an exe file that is inverted. 

used a python script to reverse the bytes. Stage2.exe created. Verified it is a DLL
File says: stage2.exe: PE32 executable (DLL) (console) Intel 80386 Mono/.Net assembly, for MS Windows

Run strings again

See strings like CryptoStreamMode, FromBase64String, ToBase64String, GetTempPath, kernel32.dll, Gzipstream,
CryptoStream,
set_DisallowStartIfOnBatteries
set_StopIfGoingOnBatteries

Ran DetectIt Easy 
Threw dll into VirusTotal - 23/70 detection
Trojan.msilheracles/msi

Did a quick check with capa

Used de4dot to deobfuscate and extract anything in the DLL. Didn't see much else with that. 

Convereted the first two XCopy lines:
echo F | xcopy /d /q /y /h /i c:\Windows\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe %temp%\Hxoaznobtmy.png
echo F | xcopy /d /q /y /7h /7i 0 %tempt%\Hxoaznobtmy.png.bat

Copying a png and a bat file that has .png in the name and not the file extension
