This repository contains:
1- Various malware analysis reports. These are my notes from analyzing various pieces of malware obtained from abuse.ch (Malware Bazaar). They contain what I discovered and understood the sample to do. 
2- Yara and Sigma Rule files I've created. These are based on real-world experiences I have encountered.
3- Python scripts - Used to help make threat analysis easier or help with threat hunting
4- Powershell scripts used to help with cybersecurity
5- Wazuh EDR project. Basic notes On things I've done while learning Wazuh on my home network
6- Classic code I've written in C++ and QBasic back in the 90s. Not cybersecurity related, but does indicate I do have some understanding of other programming languages like C++ or Basic. Even though the languages have changed a lot since the 90s.

More analysis, scripts and other cybersecurity projects will be updated as I complete them.
