Zones and interface
- Physical and virtual interfaces
- Virtual interface can be a group of IPs assigned to one physical interface
- Zone is grouping of interfaces
- Zone such as DMZ, WAN Zone, LAN Zone - logical group of networks where traffic is directed to
- Multiple interfaces can in a zone and multiple networks in a zone
- LAN is default for internal
- VPN zone does not have a physical port and can't be customized
- Types: LAN or DMZ
- Network interfaces - default named after hardware interface
- Must assign an interface to a zone before configuring
- Configure by IPv4 or IPv6 or both
- Interface Types:
** Bridge = Allows 2 or more interfaces to be used to create a transparent layer 2 or 3 bridge interface
** Vlan = Virtual LAN interface. Used when firewall needs to perform inter-VLAN routing
** Red = Remote Ethernet Devices > used to connect Sophos's RED back to firewall
** Eth = An additional IP address added to interface
** tunnel = IPSec site-to-site VPN tunnel. Used to route VPN traffic
** lag = A group of interfaces acting as a sing connection to provide redundancy and increase speed beetween 2 devices

- Static routes - set interface to Blackhole to silently drop packets 
- SD-WAN routes - determine gateway and destination networks. Based on interfaces on source and destination
- Link selection settings - Primary and backup gateways
- Routes processed based on precedence - Health Check routes, Static Routes, SD-WAN routes, IPsec VPN routes, Default Routes
- WAN Link Manager (Configure > Network > WAN Link Manager) - Configure backup gateway settings
- SD-WAN profiles - lets you route traffic based on link latency / performance - ensure business critical apps can use the best link
- Configure > Routing > SD-WAN profiles - Load balancing allows customization like round robin
- Allow options for monitoring the link - health check can be done ping or TCP - probe must be entered for the target location
- Configure based on latency, jitter, packet loss
- SD-WAN monitoring (Diagnoistics > SD-WAN performance


DNS on firewall
- DHCP, PPPoE interface sent by ISP
- Initial setup, need to setup a DNS server - upto 3 DNS servers
- Sophos firewall also acts as a firewall
- Configure DNS records on firewall itself
- Configure DNS request routes - determine what DNS server is used for each group

Control Access to Local Services
- Firewall rules can't used to control these services
- Zones allowed to access admin services (only LAN and Wifi using HTTPs and SSH
- Adding a local ACL to restrict CLI interface
- Only use local service ACL for best practices
- Sophos comes with a default appliance certificate - name is serial numbers
- Certs can added to firewall: 
-- Upload a cert signed by a trusted CA
-- Create a self-signed cert that will signed by the default signing CA
-- Create a certificate signing request that will be signed by a trusted CA
-- Create a free trusted cert using "Let's Encrypt" (not supported for VPNs)
- Two default CAs in firewall - Default: used for creating certs
- Security Appliance SLL CA - hused for HTTPS scanning and email TLS/SSL connections
- Upload additional CAs, need provide cert and private key - can be selected for web and email protection
- Generate CSR - option used to generate a certificate that wil

Traffic shaping
- Protect business continuity
- Prioritize bandwidth for cloud services
- limit bandwidth of non-business critical applications
- Control bandwidth usage from guest networks
- Configure general traffic shaping settings - System Services > Traffic Shaping Settings
- Optimize for real-time - will give it priority over anything else - some things may not get their allocated or min bandwidth
- Enforce guarantee where traffic shaping policy is not applied
- Priority set from 1 - 7
- Traffic Shaping > can be used to customize traffic shaping policies
- Traffic shaping based on Users, Rules, Web categories and applications

- Firewall rule and NAT rules - allow what goes through
- Top to bottom order (first match is used)
- If no matching rule, traffic is dropped
- Traffic is not blocked when no NAT rule matches
- Protect > Rules and Policies
- Matching criteria, source and destination / services
- Add zones to exclusions
- NAT rules can be linked to firewall rules (Linked NAT rules not recommended. Used for migration only)
- Rule position and Rule ID (unique reference)
- Green icons indiacte allow rules, red = drop / reject rules and gray = disabled rules
- Config NAT rule: Matchin Criteria, Translations, Matching Criteria, Override sour translations for outbound interfaces

Configuring TLS
- TLS inpsection rule - port and app agnostic
- Separate from firewall rules 
- Decrypted packets to IPS to web filtering and AV for inspection
- Website exclusion lists - local (customized by admin) and Managed TLS Exclusion list (Rules and Policies > SSL/TLS Inspection Rules)
- Decrypt matched traffic when it matches - Each rule has a decryption profiles
- Setup similar to firewall rules, but based on site names
- Enforcement rules can be used to block protocols. certificate errors
- Create list of domains to exclude (Web > URL Group)

Intrusion Prevention
-3 part: INtrusion Prevention System (IPS) policies, Spoof Protection and Denial-of-service (Dos) protection
- Enable IPS Protection - download IPS sigs to the firewall
- Several out-of-box prevention policies come with the firewall
- Can edit or add new ones
- Can Clone rules from other policies
- Policy is made of order list of rules
- Spoof Protection - Intrusion prevention > DoS & Spoof Protection
- Configure based on Mac address
- Denial of Service - Intrusion Prevention > DoS & Spoof Protection
- ID and block redundant traffic - can control rate limit (packets / sec) - when it is crossed, all the packets from the source will be dropped. Rest of network traffic will continue as normal

Active Threat Response

Reflexive and Loopback policies - Used when internal users use the public IP
Auto assign Sophos firewall rules to groups, need: Source Zone, Rule Type, Destination Zone

Heartbeat
- Comm between Sophos Central and endpoints & firewalls
- Regular heartbeat sent to Sophos firewall
- Heartbeat > firewall > Sophos Central
- heartbeat not supported in WAN zone, only when device is connected to local network (or VPN)
- If devices can communicate via switch, heartbeat can send back MAC address of infected system, so other devices will drop traffic from the infected system
- Heartbeat used with Endpoint protection and firewall (same account for both)
- One time passcode can be used to register firewall to Sophos Central
- Security dashboard can see number of protected devices and statuses
- Register via OTP or username / password

- Create server side of connection (Server connection)
- Server side that resolves FQDN objects to IP addr
- Download configuration file from firewall
- Client section, import configuration files 

IPsec
- Route-based VPN
-- VPN connection independent of routes for traffic
-- Routes can be modified without disconnecting VPN
-- Routes are created manually
- Policy-based VPN
-- Local and remote networks are defined as part of the VPN
-- VPN must be edited to change neworks and requires disconnecting
-- Routes auto created
- Both sides of VPN must allow the same settings
- Some profiles provided by Sophos 
- Route-based -- xfrm tunnel interface created between firewalls
- Create tunnel interface (for connection type) - Encryption - Preshared key, cert, or RSA key
- Local interface used to create VPN - need local interface and IP address of other firewall
- New interface is created, xfrm - Can't configure Zone on this interface
- Tunnel must be on the same subnet for both sides
- Policy based VPN - Wizard to walk step-by-step through the options
- General Settings, choose between ipv4 or 6
- Encryption, select profile, choose preshared key, cert, or RSA (RSA is public private connection)
- Preshared key usually much shorter and are the weakest
- Gateway settings, configure port used for connection
- Supported - AES-CBC, AES-GCM, Null cipher (not supported 3DES, 
- IPSec acceleration - Perform encryption on packet at firewall. Decrypted at other firewall using NPU

RED (Remote Ethernet Devices)
- Plug-play connectivity
- No config needed on RED device (used at remote location)
- RED needs 3400 TCP 3410 UDP open
- Provide publically avaialble Sophos URL 
- red.astaro.com - server location where red connects to then connect to the firewall
- No longer used after configured - now direct connection to firewall at main site
- Standard/Unified - All traffic routed from RED to Sophos Firewall
- Standard Split - Firewall is DHCP and only traffic designated as network goes to Sophos firewall. All other traffic goes out to internet
- Transparent/Split - Firewall is not DHCP, only traffic as network goes to firewall. Everything else goes to internet. Still need to connect firewall rules to allow remote systems to interact with site systems
- SD-RED 20 (250Mbps) and SD-RED60 (850Mbps, PoE 2X 10/100/1000 BaseTX)

Authentication
- Network access, web filtering, routing and application control
- Local authentication used on firewall, more commonly used with online resources
- Choose between user / administrator 
- Local best for small organizations (no domain)
- Authenticate with AD, eDirectory, RADIUS (used for wireless), TACACS+, LDAP (Open LDAP, Apple Directory), Azure AD SSO
- Azure AD - Use Azure AD Services directory
- Granular controls for Firewall Rules, TLS Decryption Rules, SD-WAN Policy Routes, VPNs, Web Policies, Wireless network, Web Server Authentication, user Portal, VPN Portal, Web Admin Console

External Authentications servers
- If network has a DC, RADIUS, etc.
- Configure > Authentication > Servers - Add
- Enter info, click Test server
- AD server: Server type, Servername, Server IP, Connection (SSL/TLS), Port, NetBIOS domain, AD username / password)
- After AD has been added, user created when user signs on
- Assigned to first group that matches
- Base DN = base DN for domain
- Enable policies to groups
- RADIUS allows routers to authenticate users
- Accounting - for tracking / auditing / billing
- StartTLS - Starts in plain text SSLTLS - encrypted at the beginning
- LDAP requires cert 
- Signed cert, or from LDAP or from one generated from firewall and import into LDAP server

Configure Azure AD SSO
- SSO for admin and users
- Manage admins roles and groups
- Use Open ID and Oauth 2.0

- Choose what policies to apply to each group or all (can also customize policies)
- Firewall rule requires authentication that provides access to Azure AD sign on
- Azure token is valid for 7 days by default - user must explicitly log out to invalidate the token
- No way to change admin user to standard user
- Autentication Servers section where you can find URI needed for Azure AD SSO

Authentication methods in order of precedence
Hotspot, Clientless Users, Clientless SSO, Authentication Agent, Captive Portal
- Hotspot controls provides guest network wireless 
- Provide full suite of protections, like captive portal, etc.
- Clientless users (authenticated by IP), guest (Temp users) users, users (authenticated by user and password)
- Use this for things like printers, phones (clientless users)
- Sync Users - lets user authentication through security heartbeat
- Sync user ID default (must have an AD server on firewall)
- Captive portal port 8090
- Can customize captive portal
- Sophos transparent Authentication (STAS)
-- Uses an agent installed onto Domain Controllers
-- Requires one STAS installation servering each DC
-- Provides SSO w/o a client on the endpoints
-- Only supports IPv4
-- Download software from Configure > Authentication, Client Downloads
-- Configure STAS software
-- Add Sophos firewall IPv4 address
-- Default collector port 6677 (collector groups)
- Another way - use an agent on each endpoint - Agent authenticates with Sophos firewall
- Google Workspace Authentication through LDAP
- Google admin - create LDAP client, cert and access credentials
- Google LDAP uses version 3. Anon login not supported, Append Base DN for authentication to work
MFA authentication
- One Time Password - user has token - gets time and token code - sync with token from firewall
-- Token offset step
